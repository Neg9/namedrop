Building/Configuring/Whatever:

SEE OS_STATUS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR SPECIFIC SYSTEM AND THIS SOFTWARE

a) get and install c-ares ( http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/ ) if at all possible
b) run ./configure --with-your-arguments
  1) you may need to run configure like:
     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" ./configure
     if you are running certain os'es that dont search /usr/local by default and have
     installed c-ares into /usr/local
c) type make
d) type make install
e) goto http://www.dyadsecurity.com/s_softwarefeedback.html and please fill it in so we
can make better software in the future.

DESTDIR is supported for making packages, make uninstall also works to remove the software
from your system. please note that the default config file is preserved, so if you make install
twice, you will not overwrite your already present configuration file, if you uninstall this
software you will need to manually remove the configuration file(s) (sysconfdir)/(progname)/(progname).conf.new

basic usage:

### wordlist based A (forward) record brute force:

namedrop -ve domain.tld

### wordlist (possibly $PREFIX/share/namedrop/oz or $PREFIX/share/namedrop/os.gz) based A record brute force:
namedrop -ve -f oz domain.tld

### wordlist specifically with /usr/share/dict/words based A record brute force:
namedrop -ve -f /usr/share/dict/words domain.tld

### to enable SQL output (for the same as above):
(the schema you want is located inside sql/ )

namedrop -ves domain.tld

the direction flag in the SQL output means:
	0: Reverse Lookup
	1: Forward Lookup

### to Brute force hostnames from 2 to 4 characters: (db.domain.tld -> www2.domain.tld)

namedrop -ve -b2-4 domain.tld

### reverse dns based sweep of a cidr range:

namedrop -v -r www.google.com/24

### reverse dns scanning a ipv6 range:

namedrop -v -6r 6bone.net/114
