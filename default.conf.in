# configuration file for @PROGNAME@, (@SYSCONFDIR@/@PROGNAME@.conf)
# default values are in the commented out example setting. command line options
# will override the values in this file.

#
# There are 3 modes of operation, dict (dictionary host guessing), brute force mode, and reverse mode.
#
#mode:		dict

#
# By default, ipv4 and ipv6 look ups are attempted, if you know there are no ipv6 records, or don't care,
# uncomment this following like, possible values are ipv4, ipv6 (only ipv6) and ipv46 for both
#
#addrfam:	ipv46

# during brute force mode, allowed determines what characters are used during hostname creation, and also
# the wildcard host name (the sillyhostname) { if not specified } is created randomly from this character
# list as well.
#
#allowed:	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._

#
# async (if supported during compile time) has 2 types of settings, no for forcing sync dns look ups
# or a number controlling how many dns look ups are queued at any given time, too large a value may
# cause the scanner to malfunction, ymmv
#
#async:	16

#
# dictfile is the dictionary (a file containing words on separate lines) that will be asked for,
# the default is @SHAREDIR@/default, generally a symlink to another file. you may
# specify a fully qualified path or simply a file name, and the following search will be used
# 1) look for a file called `foo'
# 2) look for a compressed (gzip) file called `foo.gz'
# 3) look in @SHAREDIR@ for a file called `foo'
# 4) look in @SHAREDIR@ for a file called `foo.gz'
#
#dictfile:	default

#
# sillyhostname (if specified) will be the hostname that we look for to determine if the dns server
# will send back a reply for anything we ask for, if found the address records for this `wildcard'
# will be ignored, IE; if we ask for ldfkgjfkdfjgkldfg.foo.bar and later we ask for mail.foo.bar
# and they have the same address, then we will assume that the host mail.foo.bar does not exist
# if not specified, the sillyhostname will be randomly created from the `allowed' characters
#
# NOTE: there is no default sillyhostname, it is randomly generated, if you specify it, it will no
# longer be random.
#
#sillyhostname:	foobar393849384_sdfkjdsf

#
# verbose is a numeric argument containing the level of verbosity that you want to see from the scan,
# if it is set high, a lot of output will be available, sometimes useful for troubleshooting (if you
# find a bug, try setting this high, and see if it clears up the reason)
#
#verbose:	0

#
# exact means that you want to know exactly what names matched the query, IE; if you got an answer
# back for www.foo.bar, and the record indicates that it is an alias for web.foo.bar, then exact mode
# will say that www.foo.bar is a CNAME and that there is an A record for web.foo.bar. otherwise
# it would have just told you that www.foo.bar had address x.x.x.x
#
#exact:		1

#
# discover mode means that when a record is found, then more information will be attempted from this
# information. for example if we find printer.foo.bar then in discover mode, we will ask about the HINFO
# record for printer.foo.bar
#
#discover:	1

#
# filter is a numeric argument that specifies if duplicate record detection is used, IE if we get back
# 2 records for www.foo.bar with the same address, then if filtered we will only display one.
#
#filter:	1
