.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
namedrop:
There are three basic modes of operation, dictionary brute force mode, general brute force mode and 
reverse IP sweep mode. Dictionary brute force mode may use a (possibly compressed) file specified at the 
command line, containing a hostnames separated by newlines. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-4\fP
 Imply that all questions are for IPV4, possibly requiring half the amount of questions 
to be asked if IPV6 questions were also enabled. 
.TP
\fB\-6\fP
 Does exactly the same thing as \fB\-4\fP
but it enables IPV6 not IPV4. This option can 
also possibly serve to disambiguate the meaning of a hostname, that otherwise could return an IPV4 
and a IPV6 record, in such a case the best guess is generally to use the IPV4 address record. 
.TP
\fB\-a\fP\fI number\fP
 Concurrency for asynchronous resolver (how many questions to leave pending in parallel). This option 
requires c\-ares support to be enabled. Some experimentation is generally required to get this value at 
a optimal setting, as it depends on the DNS cache(s) that are available. 
.TP
\fB\-b\fP\fI number\-number\fP
 Brute force mode, with mandatory argument in the form of \fB\-b\fP\fI 3\fP
or \fB\-b\fP\fI 3\-4\fP
to brute force 
hostnames from 1 (implied) to 3 characters, and from 3 to 4 characters, respectively. 
.TP
\fB\-c\fP\fI characters\fP
 If inside of brute force mode, a list of characters that will be used to create hostnames from, such as 
\fB\-c\fP\fI abcdefghjiklmnopqrstuvwxyz\-\fP\&.
This option will also effect the random `wildcard\&' host 
(if not specifically specified otherwise with \fB\-H\fP)
that is asked for to detect a default forward 
record. 
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
 Not yet implemented. 
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
 Dictionary Brute force Mode (default). 
.TP
\fB\-e\fP
 Display an exact output of data as returned by name server (only generally useful in a forward lookup mode). 
If this option is selected CNAME records will be displayed so it is obvious what actual question generated 
the A record output. 
.TP
\fB\-f\fP\fI filename\fP
 Filename that will be used inside of a Dictionary mode brute force, the search order used to locate the file 
is 1) locate a file in the current directory 2) append on \&.gz to the filename and locate it within the current 
directory 2) prepend SHAREDIR (possibly /usr/local/share/namedrop or /usr/share/namedrop) onto the filename 
3) append \&.gz to SHAREDIR/filename. Stated simply \fB\-f\fP\fI foo\fP
will become, \&./foo, \&./foo.gz, 
/usr/share/namedrop/foo, and finally /usr/share/namedrop/foo.gz. 
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
 Do not attempt to remove duplicate output, possibly display the same results over and over. 
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
 Display command line program help. 
.TP
\fB\-H\fP\fI hostname\fP
 Explicit hostname to be used during wildcard hostname detection. 
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
 Reverse DNS sweeping mode (gather hostnames from a cidr address range), use \fB\-4\fP
or \fB\-6\fP
to specify 
exactly what you want, otherwise the programs interpretation can be seemingly random. 
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
 Output will be SQL, all data output will be in the form of SQL insert statements, and all non\-data output 
will be preceded with an SQL comment (\-\-) so that a pipe may be used to interface to a command line SQL 
monitor program like \fIpsql\fP(1)\&.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
 Force synchronous DNS behavior, only useful if c\-ares support is compiled in, as asynchronous questions 
are default in that case. 
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
 For each \fB\-v\fP
increase verbosity of program, useful when trying to locate a problem. 
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
 Display program version. 
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES

\fBnamedrop \-ve4 domain.tld \fP
Dictionary Brute force the domain `domain.tld\&' for hostnames within asking for IPV4 records only. 
If CNAMES are discovered \fI\-e\fP
then display them with the actual A record returned. Also 
display a small amount of information about things the program is doing. 
.PP
.SH FILES

.TP
namedrop.conf
 The file containing the default configuration options for usage.
